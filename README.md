## Roadmap for Future Improvements
* Create different styling templates for the user to choose from at the start of the game. This can be implemented by creating a button with onClick event that can toggle various css styles.
* Keep track of scores for each round played. This can be done by keeping state with each player's round score that is intialized with 0 that increments with a win for that player.
